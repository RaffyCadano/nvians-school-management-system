# Admin Software — Electron scaffold

Quick start

1. Open a terminal in this folder:

   cd software/admin-software

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the app:

   npm start

Notes

- `package.json` includes `electron` as a devDependency; running `npm install` will fetch it.
- The main process is `src/main.js`. Renderer files live in `src/renderer`.
- If you want a production build, I can add `electron-builder` or similar.
